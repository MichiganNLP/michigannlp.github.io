}","Many people aim for change, but not everyone succeeds. While there are a number of social psychology theories that propose motivation-related characteristics of those who persist with change, few computational studies have explored the motivational stage of personal change. In this paper, we investigate a new dataset consisting of the writings of people who manifest intention to change, some of whom persist while others do not. Using a variety of linguistic analysis techniques, we first examine the writing patterns that distinguish the two groups of people. Persistent people tend to reference more topics related to long-term self-improvement and use a more complicated writing style. Drawing on these consistent differences, we build a classifier that can reliably identify the people more likely to persist, based on their language. Our experiments provide new insights into the motivation-related behavior of people who persist with their intention to change.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

Since the result of the ASR step is considered as a meaningful, informative input to later steps in the NLP pipeline, it is important to understand the behavior and failure mode of this step. In this work, we analyze the quality of ASR in the psychotherapy domain, using motivational interviewing conversations between therapists and clients. We conduct domain agnostic and domain-relevant evaluations using evaluation metrics and also identify domain-relevant keywords in the ASR output.

Stress and emotion are both human affective states, and stress has proven to have important implications on the regulation and expression of emotion. Although a series of methods have been established for multimodal stress detection, limited steps have been taken to explore the underlying inter-dependence between stress and emotion. In this work, we investigate the value of emotion recognition as an auxiliary task to improve stress detection. We propose MUSER – a transformer-based model architecture and a novel multi-task learning algorithm with speed-based dynamic sampling strategy.

Research to date has focused on datasets with a large number of training samples, manual transcriptions, and nearly-balanced sentiment labels. However, data collection in real settings often leads to small datasets with noisy transcriptions and imbalanced label distributions, which are therefore significantly more challenging than in controlled settings. In this work, we introduce MORSE, a domain-specific dataset for MultimOdal sentiment analysis in Real-life SEttings. The dataset consists of 2,787 video clips extracted from 49 interviews with panelists in a product usage study, with each clip annotated for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The characteristics of MORSE include noisy transcriptions from raw videos, naturally imbalanced label distribution, and scarcity of minority labels. To address the challenging real-life settings in MORSE, we propose a novel two-step fine-tuning method for multimodal sentiment classification using transfer learning and the Transformer model architecture; our method starts with a pre-trained language model and one step of fine-tuning on the language modality, followed by the second step of joint fine-tuning that incorporates the visual and audio modalities. Experimental results show that while MORSE is challenging for various baseline models such as SVM and Transformer, our two-step fine-tuning method is able to capture the dataset characteristics and effectively address the challenges.

When analyzing utterances in such conversations, it is not sufficient to consider each sentence in isolation, since its context may play a role in determining its semantic meaning. Recently, contextual information in natural language documents has been modeled using various techniques, such as recurrent neural networks with latent variables, or neural networks with attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present UnsuPerviSed conText AuGmEntation (Upstage), a classification framework that relies on both local and global contextual information from different sources.  Upstage uses transformer models with pretrained language models and joint sentence representation to solve the task of classifying health topics in patient-provider conversations.
In addition, Upstage leverages unlabeled corpora for pretraining and data augmentation to provide additional context, which leads to improved classification performance.

}","Stories are one of the main tools that humans use to make sense of the world around them. This ability is conjectured to be uniquely human, and concepts of agency and interaction have been found to develop during childhood. However, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models still find it very challenging to represent or understand such information about the world. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of research into building systems that can understand the contents of images, videos, and text. Despite several advances made, computers still struggle to understand high-level discourse structures or how visuals and language are organized to tell a coherent story. Recently, several efforts have been made towards building story understanding benchmarks. As characters are the key component around which the story events unfold, character representations are crucial for deep story understanding such as their names, appearances, and relations to other characters. As a step towards endowing systems with a richer understanding of characters in a given narrative, this thesis develops new techniques that rely on the vision, audio and language channels to address three important challenges: i) speaker recognition and identification, ii) character representation and embedding, and iii) temporal modeling of character relations. We propose a multi-modal unsupervised model for speaker naming in movies, a novel way to represent movie character names in dialogues, and a multi-modal supervised character relation classification model. We also show that our approach improves systems ability to understand narratives, which is measured using several tasks such as their ability to answer questions about stories on several benchmarks.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

}","The underlying traits of our demographic group affect and shape our thoughts, and therefore surface in the way we express ourselves and employ language in our day-to-day life. Understanding and analyzing language use in people from different demographic backgrounds help uncover their demographic particularities. Conversely, leveraging these differences could lead to the development of better language representations, thus enabling further demographic-focused refinements in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this thesis, I employ methods rooted in computational linguistics to better understand various demographic groups through their language use. The thesis makes two main contributions.
</br>First, it provides empirical evidence that words are indeed used differently by different demographic groups in naturally occurring text. Through experiments conducted on large datasets which display usage scenarios for hundreds of frequent words, I show that automatic classification methods can be effective in distinguishing between word usages of different demographic groups. I compare the encoding ability of the utilized features by conducting feature analyses, and shed light on how various attributes contribute to highlighting the differences.
</br>Second, the thesis explores whether demographic differences in word usage by different groups can inform the development of more refined approaches to NLP tasks. Specifically, I start by investigating the task of word association prediction. The thesis shows that going beyond the traditional ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, demographic-aware models achieve better performances in predicting word associations for different demographic groups than generic ones. Next, I investigate the impact of demographic information on part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing, and the experiments reveal numerous part-of-speech tags and syntactic relations, whose predictions benefit from the prevalence of a specific group in the training data. Finally, I explore demographic-specific humor generation, and develop a humor generation framework to fill-in the blanks to generate funny stories, while taking into account people’s demographic backgrounds.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

}","Grit is a prominent personality trait that measures an individuals passion and perseverance for long-term goals. Grit entails that zeal and persistence of motive play a key role in determining an individuals success in the long run, as opposed to natural talent. But how does one identify and distinguish between gritty and non-gritty individuals? Do they use language differently? In this paper, we seek to answer these questions using a social media setting. We build a new crowd-sourced Twitter corpus that contains the posts of 464 users along with their grit scores, and explore how grit correlates with other major behavioural and personality traits. We then train machine learning classification models to predict the grit level of an individual using his/her Twitter posts, and show that language can be effectively used to infer this personality trait.",,,,,,,LIT,TRUE,Grit Tweet Dataset,"Grit is a prominent personality trait that measures an individual's passion and perseverance for long-term goals.

Hence, it is crucial to build computational tools that can help evaluate the quality of these videos so that users can obtain accurate information to help inform their decisions. In this study, we focus on the automatic detection of misinformation in YouTube videos. We select prostate cancer videos as our entry point to tackle this problem. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 250 videos related to prostate cancer manually annotated for misinformation. Second, we explore the use of linguistic, acoustic, and user engagement features for the development of classification models to identify misinformation.

We explore the degree to which we can employ computational models to infer people's values from the text that they write and the everyday activities that they perform. In addition to investigating how personal values are expressed in language, we use natural language processing methods to automatically discover relationships between a person's values, behaviors, and cultural background. To this end, we show that the automatic analysis of less constrained, open-ended essay questions leads to a model of personal values that is more strongly connected to behaviors than traditional forced-choice value surveys, and that cultural background has a significant influence these connections. To help measure personal values in textual data, we use a novel crowd-powered sorting algorithm to construct a hierarchical lexicon of words and phrases related to human values. Additionally, we develop semantic representations of human activities that capture a variety of useful dimensions such the motivation for which they are typically done. We leverage these representations to build deep neural models that are able to make predictions about a person's activities based on their observed linguistic patterns and inferred values.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

We investigate how keyword extraction can be formulated on social media data, such as emails, product reviews, student discussions, and student statements of purpose. We design novel graph-based features for supervised and unsupervised keyword extraction from emails, and use the resulting system with success to uncover patterns in a new dataset -- student statements of purpose. Furthermore, the system is used with new features on the problem of usage expression extraction from product reviews, where we obtain interesting insights. The system while used on student discussions, uncover new and exciting patterns. While each of the above problems is conceptually distinct, they share two key common elements -- keywords and social data. Social data can be messy, hard-to-interpret, and not easily amenable to existing NLP resources. We show that our system is robust enough in the face of such challenges to discover useful and important patterns. We also show that the problem definition of keyword extraction itself can be expanded to accommodate new and challenging research questions and datasets.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

This paper focuses on online mental health communities and studies how users’ contributions to these communities change over one year. We define a metric called the Mental Health Contribution Index (MHCI), which we use to measure the degree to which users’ contributions to mental health topics change over a one-year period. In this work, we study the relationship between MHCI scores and the online expression of mental health symptoms by extracting relevant linguistic features from user-generated content and conducting statistical analyses. Additionally, we build a classifier to predict whether or not a user’s contributions to mental health sub-reddits will increase or decrease. Finally, we employ propensity score matching to identify factors that correlate with an increase or a decrease in mental health forum contributions. Our work provides some of the first insights into detecting and understanding social media users’ changes in mental health states over time.",Socinfo_18_TextBasedChangesInMH,Text-Based Detection and Understanding of Changes in Mental Health,"Yaoyiran Li, Rada Mihalcea, Steven R.

For the latter, CASCADE aims at extracting contextual information from the discourse of a discussion thread. Also, since the sarcastic nature and form of expression can vary from person to person, CASCADE utilizes user embeddings that encode stylometric and personality features of users.

More recent work on deception has expanded to other applications, such as deception detection in social media, interviews, or deception in daily life. Moreover, recent research on deception detection has brought together scientists from fields as diverse as computational linguistics, speech processing, computer vision, psychology, and physiology, which makes this problem particularly appealing for multimodal processing. </br></br>This chapter will overview the state-of-the-art in multimodal deception detection, covering physiological (e.g., biosensors and thermal imaging), visual (e.g., facial expressions and gestures), speech (e.g., pitch and pause length), and linguistic modalities. We will describe the features that are typically extracted from each of these modalities, as well as means to combine these modalities into an overall system that can detect deception in multimodal content. We will cover methods that make use of lab recordings, as well as methods that rely on real life data (e.g., recent work on multimodal deception detection from trial data).

Experimental results suggest that physiological and thermal information can be used to recognize gender at reasonable accuracy levels, which are comparable to the accuracy of current gender prediction systems. Furthermore, we show that the use of non-contact physiological measurements, such as thermography readings, can enhance current systems that are based on audio or visual input. This can be particularly useful for scenarios where non-contact approaches are preferred, i.e., when data is captured under noisy audiovisual conditions or when video or speech data are not available due to ethical considerations.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

However, unless care is taken to avoid it, models may be developed in one cultural setting and deployed in another, leading to unforeseen consequences. We explore the effects of using models built from a corpus of texts from multiple cultures in order to learn about each represented people group separately. To do this, we employ a topic modeling approach to quantify open-ended writing responses describing personal values and everyday behaviors in two distinct cultures. We show that some topics are more prominent in one culture compared to the other, while other topics are mentioned to similar degrees. Furthermore, our results indicate that culture influences how value-behavior relationships are exhibited. While some relationships exist in both cultural groups, in most cases we see that the observed relations are dependent on the cultural background of the data set under examination.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

Among all available modalities, we focus on three modalities namely, language use, physiological response, and thermal sensing. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate these specific modalities to detect deceit. Several experiments are carried out in which we first select representative features for each modality, and then we analyze joint models that integrate several modalities. The experimental results show that the combination of features from different modalities significantly improves the detection of deceptive behaviors as compared to the use of one modality at a time. Moreover, the use of non-contact modalities proved to be comparable with and sometimes better than existing contact-based methods. The proposed method increases the efficiency of detecting deceit by avoiding human involvement in an attempt to move towards a completely automated non-invasive deception detection process.

In this paper, we seek to explore whether senses aligned across languages exhibit this trait consistently, and if this is the case, we investigate how this property can be leveraged in an automatic fashion. We first conduct a manual annotation study to gauge whether the subjectivity trait of a sense can be robustly transferred across language boundaries. An automatic framework is then introduced that is able to predict subjectivity labeling for unseen senses using either cross-lingual or multilingual training enhanced with bootstrapping. We show that the multilingual model consistently outperforms the cross-lingual one, with an accuracy of over 73% across all iterations.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

We describe a rich set of feature representations that are derived from salient Wikipedia structures, as well as from syntactic and semantic processings of text. A bootstrapped version of the system is used to create additional features for itself, leading to improvements in extraction accuracy.

}","Socrates articulated it best, ""Speak, so I may see you."" Indeed, language represents an invisible probe into the mind. It is the medium through which we express our deepest thoughts, our aspirations, our views, our feelings, our inner reality. From the beginning of artificial intelligence, researchers have sought to impart human like understanding to machines. As much of our language represents a form of self expression, capturing thoughts, beliefs, evaluations, opinions, and emotions which are not available for scrutiny by an outside observer, in the field of natural language, research involving these aspects has crystallized under the name of subjectivity and sentiment analysis. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification further divides subjective text into either positive, negative or neutral. In this thesis, I investigate techniques of generating tools and resources for subjectivity analysis that do not rely on an existing natural language processing infrastructure in a given language. This constraint is motivated by the fact that the vast majority of human languages are scarce from an electronic point of view: they lack basic tools such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, or basic resources such as electronic text, annotated corpora or lexica. This severely limits the implementation of techniques on par with those developed for English, and by applying methods that are lighter in the usage of text processing infrastructure, we are able to conduct multilingual subjectivity research in these languages as well. Since my aim is also to minimize the amount of manual work required to develop lexica or corpora in these languages, the techniques proposed employ a lever approach, where English often acts as the donor language (the fulcrum in a lever) and allows through a relatively minimal amount of effort to establish preliminary subjectivity research in a target language.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification adds an additional level of granularity, by further classifying subjective text as either positive, negative or neutral.
 </br></br>
While much of the research work in this area has been applied to English, research on other languages is growing, including Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Romanian. While most of the researchers in the field are familiar with the methods applied on English, few of them have closely looked at the original research carried out in other languages. For example, in languages such as Chinese, researchers have been looking at the ability of characters to carry sentiment information (Ku et al., 2005; Xiang, 2011). In Romanian, due to markers of politeness and additional verbal modes embedded in the language, experiments have hinted that subjectivity detection may be easier to achieve (Banea et al., 2008). These additional sources of information may not be available across all languages, yet, various articles have pointed out that by investigating a synergistic approach for detecting subjectivity and sentiment in multiple languages at the same time, improvements can be achieved not only in other languages, but in English as well. The development and interest in these methods is also highly motivated by the fact that only 27% of Internet users speak English (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, Oct 11, 2011), and that number diminishes further every year, as more people across the globe gain Internet access.
 </br></br>
The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize the attendees with the subjectivity and sentiment research carried out on languages other than English in order to enable and promote cross-fertilization. Specifically, we will review work along three main directions. First, we will present methods where the resources and tools have been specifically developed for a given target language. In this category, we will also briefly overview the main methods that have been proposed for English, but which can be easily ported to other languages. Second, we will describe cross-lingual approaches, including several methods that have been proposed to leverage on the resources and tools available in English by using cross-lingual projections. Finally, third, we will show how the expression of opinions and polarity pervades language boundaries, and thus methods that holistically explore multiple languages at the same time can be effectively considered.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

This paper reports two kinds of contributions. First, we employ automatic language processing, semantic analysis, and reflexive ethnography to articulate gender preferences for several dimensions of gender space will provide valuable insight to user interface designers– time, color, size, socialness, affect, and cravings. Second, we employ statistical gender models to build GENDERLENS–a novel intelligent news filtering system that customizes news based on the gender of its reader. A user evaluation found that GENDERLENS successfully predicted men and women’s preferences for news, with statistical significance for four out of five news genres tested.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

We evaluate our corpus-based approach in a classification task and contrast our wordlist with emotionally-annotated wordlists produced by experimental focus groups.

For programming, however, the necessity of a formal programming language for communicating with a computer has always been taken for granted. We would like to challenge this assumption. We believe that modern Natural Language Processing techniques can make possible the use of natural language to (at least partially) express programming ideas, thus drastically increasing the accessibility of programming to non-expert users. To demonstrate the feasibility of Natural Language Programming, this paper tackles what are perceived to be some of the hardest cases: steps and loops.

We argue that by modeling feature weights using these scores, as opposed to the traditional frequency-based scores, we can achieve better results in a text classification task.

By linking them together, we build an improved resource in which (1) the coverage of FrameNet is extended, (2) the VerbNet lexicon is augmented with frame semantics, and (3) selectional restrictions are implemented using WordNet semantic classes.

The growth of the Web on these two main dimensions – pages and users – has opened the doors to a realm of new approaches to data-hungry and knowledge-hungry language processing applications. Among these, Word Sense Disambiguation is one of the applications that has the potential of benefiting the most from the large amounts of Web-based data and from the availability of inexpensive Web user supervision. In this paper, I overview the main lines of research in deriving efficient Word Sense Disambiguation methods that exploit: (1) the Web as a corpus – which represents a view of the Web seen as an enormous collection of Web pages; and (2) the Web as collective mind – where the Web is regarded as a large group of Web users who can contribute their knowledge to the process of identifying word meanings.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

The method requires no additional tagging tools or resources other than raw text, which makes it independent of the language, and particularly appealing for languages for which there are few resources available. The algorithm was evaluated on four different languages, namely Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Romanian, and an average accuracy of over 98% was observed.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,

}","The IRSLO (Information Retrieval using Semantic and Lexical Operators) project aims at integrating semantic and lexical information into the retrieval process, in order to overcome some of the impediments currently encountered with today’s information retrieval systems. This paper introduces the semantic wildcard, one of the most powerful operators implemented in IRSLO, which allows for searches along general-specific lines. The semantic wildcard, denoted with #, acts in a manner similar with the lexical wildcard, but at semantic levels, enabling the retrieval of subsumed concepts. For instance, a search for <i>animal</i># will match any concept that is of type <i>animal</i>, including <i>dog</i>, <i>goat</i> and so forth, thereby going beyond the explicit knowledge stated in texts. This operator, together with a lexical locality operator that enables the retrieval of paragraphs rather than entire documents, have been both implemented in the IRSLO system and tested on requests of information run against an index of 130,000 documents. Significant improvement was observed over classic keyword-based retrieval systems in terms of precision, recall and success rate.",,,,,,,LIT,TRUE,QA Data Set: Annotated Questions,"Annotations for about 5,500 questions used in an analysis of information requests.
