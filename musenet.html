            <h3><a name="about">About</a></h3>
            <p class="lead">This project is devoted to building a large multilingual semantic network through the application of novel techniques for semantic analysis specifically targeted at the Wikipedia corpus. The driving hypothesis of the project is that the structure of Wikipedia can be effectively used to create a highly structured graph of world knowledge in which nodes correspond to entities and concepts described in Wikipedia, while edges capture ontological relations such as hypernymy and meronymy. Special emphasis is given to exploiting the multilingual information available in Wikipedia in order to improve the performance of each semantic analysis tool. Significant research effort is therefore aimed at developing tools for word sense disambiguation, reference resolution and the extraction of ontological relations that use multilingual reinforcement and the consistent structure and focused content of Wikipedia to solve these tasks accurately. An additional research challenge is the effective integration of inherently noisy evidence from multiple Wikipedia articles in order to increase the reliability of the overall knowledge encoded in the global Wikipedia graph. Computing probabilistic confidence values for every piece of structural information added to the network is an important step in this integration, and it is also meant to provide increased utility for downstream applications. The proposed highly structured semantic network complements existing semantic resources and is expected to have a broad impact on a wide range of natural language processing applications in need of large scale world knowledge.</p>

Additionally, a dataset was also constructed by clustering a set of Semeval word senses. All datasets follow the same format, and consist of pairs of articles annotated as either positive or negative, depending on whether they should be grouped together under one sense or not.
